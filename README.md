# Question workflow app

This is a project built with [Strapi](https://docs.strapi.io/). It allows admin users who have access to the Strapi Admin panel can define a collection of questions and possible answers. 

This project works in conjunction with [question-workflow-app-frontend](https://github.com/lrasata/question-workflow-frontend-app) which presents the workflow questions to the end-user who is able to select its answers.


### Backend built with Strapi

Strapi is a headless CMS. In this case, it is used to define the schema of a question :

![strapi-question-schema](./docs/strapi-question-schema.png)

And it allows admin users of teh Strapi admin panel to quickly provide data entries

![strapi-question-entry](./docs/strapi-question-entry.png)

Data entries are then available for read on the following endpoint : `/api/questions`
